## What is geospatial electrification planning?

Geospatial electrification planning has become the best-practice approach to determining how best to electrify people, using which technologies, and at what cost. This planning approach establishes high-resolution geospatial data systems to provide:

- Long-term electricity demand forecasts 
- Cost estimates of electricity supply options such as grid, mini-grid, and stand-alone systems to reach the potential consumers
- Algorithmic, least-cost optimization of grid and off-grid systems, including a roll-out plan with phased investments *over time* to achieve universal electricity access or a given electrification target

## How geospatial electrification planning is used by the Africa Region of the EEXGP?

- To help inform operations (eg. Estimate potential and scope for access interventions or help with project design)
- To help countries think about critical elements of and inform National Electrification Strategies
- To promote transparency and rationality in Government planning and decision-making
